        <h2>Last Season Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Last season was a near disaster, where it got so bad I could no longer watch that many games. What I saw was the failure of Josh Donaldson, who couldn't even top .150, injuries, and an overall lack of motivation from the entire team.
            There is much more to be said about last year, but I'm looking forward to discussing much brighter pastures this year with the addition of two young guys who know how to hit. They are former Red Sox outfielder Alex Verdugo and the elite Juan Soto.
            As far as pitching goes, I've heard rumors that Gerrit Cole is injured, and let's only hope those are rumors. With Cole healthy and the addition of Marcus Stroman, improved Rodon, and a healthy Nestor Cortez, we should be ready to go. Here is an analysis of each player through my eyes.
