            <p>In a stunning development that has rocked the baseball world, New York Yankees captain and slugger Aaron Judge has officially announced his retirement from Major League Baseball, citing a desire to spend more time with his wife, Samantha Bracksieck, and their newborn child.</p>
            <p>Judge, 32, made the announcement in a heartfelt press conference earlier today, stating that while baseball has been his life’s passion, "nothing comes before family." Sources close to the Yankees organization indicate that Judge’s decision came as a surprise, as he was expected to remain the face of the franchise for years to come.</p>
            <p>"This was the hardest decision of my life," Judge said in an emotional statement. "But after a lot of conversations with my wife and family, I realized it was time for a new chapter. Baseball has given me everything, and I will forever be grateful to the Yankees, my teammates, and the fans."</p>
            <p>Yankees general manager Brian Cashman released a statement shortly after the announcement, saying, "Aaron Judge is one of the greatest players to ever wear the pinstripes. While we are saddened by his decision, we respect and support him fully. His impact on this franchise and the game of baseball will never be forgotten."</p>
            <p>The retirement sends shockwaves through Major League Baseball, as Judge was widely considered one of the league’s top superstars. After setting the American League home run record in 2022 and signing a massive contract extension in 2023, few expected his career to come to an abrupt end so soon.</p>
            <p>Fans and analysts are already speculating on how the Yankees will move forward without their captain. With the season already underway, the team must quickly adjust to life without their biggest star.</p>
